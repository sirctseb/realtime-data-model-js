Realtime Data Model
==========================

This project is a library that constrains the Google Drive Realtime API and provides a local implementation so that applications can write to a single API whether the backing data is a Google Document or a local object.

It is based on [Google Drive Realtime](https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime/).

## Usage ##
To use this library in your code :

* add a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` :

```yaml
dependencies:
  realtime_data_model: "0.0.0"
```

* add import in your `dart` code :

```dart
import 'package:realtime_data_model/realtime_data_model.dart';
```

* Follow the steps described at [Create a Realtime Application](https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime/application) or begin using the library locally with:

```dart
start(realtimeOptions, local: true)
```

The library is currently unstable and does not support custom objects or databinding.
